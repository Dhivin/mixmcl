# Mixmcl
2D MCL with mixture proposal distributions

## Requirement
* ROS Indigo - Refer to package.xml for ROS package information
* Nuklei - Note that the kernel type of kernel::se3 has to be modified to Gaussian kernel instead of Triangular kernel
* FLANN - This library is used for kdtree and 1-nearest-neighbor search.
### Installation
#### Nuklei
#### FLANN

## Functions
* MCL with mixture proposals by using pre-built sampling
* MCL with mixture proposals by using Evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling

### Performance comparison
#### Global Localisation Problem


#### Kidnapped Robot Problem
